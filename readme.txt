
To host a PHP web application locally, you'll need to set up a web server, such as Apache, and a database like MySQL.

Steps:

- Download and install XAMPP on your local machine.
- Once installed, navigate to the htdocs folder in the XAMPP installation directory. This is where you'll store your PHP files.
- Clone the GitHub repository of the PHP application into the htdocs folder.
- Open the connection.php file in the PHP application folder and update the hostname, username, and password with the appropriate values for your MySQL server.
- Start the XAMPP control panel and start the Apache and MySQL services.
- In your web browser, access the signup.html and login.html file by entering the URL http://localhost/your_application_folder/{html_file_name} for registration and login.
